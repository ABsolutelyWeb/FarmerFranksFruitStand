# Farmer Frank's Fruit Stand: A JSON Display Application

## Introduction
I created a web application that takes JSON data from a source and displays specific information to a view. It displays a wide array of fruits for sale by various farms in Connecticut. My application does NOT require any for-pay software to function.
 
## Assumptions
1. All information is to be displayed on a single page.
2. Any tech stack can be used (GIVEN).
3. The individual posts are to be sorted in alphabetical order by city (GIVEN).

## How to Run

OPTION 1:

* Follow the instructions given for Cloud9.

OPTION 2:

1. git clone https://github.com/AbhishekNose/FarmerFranksFruitStand.git
2. cd into the folder
3. bundle install --without production
4. bundle exec rails server
	* Use whatever command you use to start the server.


## Tools
I will utilize the following tools:
* **HTML5** (for the skeleton of my application)
* **CSS3** (to style my application)
* **Bootstrap** (my frontend framework for the navbar and table)
* **Ruby** & **Ruby on Rails** (where the fun stuff begins)

Other Noteworthy Tools:
* **Cloud9 IDE**
* **Google Fonts**
* **Unsplash** (for copyright-free images)

Noteworthy Gems:
* **Autoprefixer** (automatically makes CSS cross-platform)
